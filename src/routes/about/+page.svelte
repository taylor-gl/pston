  <strong>About</strong>
  <p>
    This is a project to help people learn to pronounce names correctly. It's a pain to figure out
    how a name should be pronounced, because unless you can find a video of that person saying their
    own name, you end up finding conflicting answers and you don't know who you can trust. This
    website serves as a repository of people saying their own name, so you never have to guess.

  <p>
    The site is open source, and you can find the code on <a
      href="https://github.com/taylor-gl/pston">GitHub</a
    >.
